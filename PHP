PHP - Server side scripting language

helps you talk to server - high performance and scalable

to create a php file you can save file (or html file)  with a php extension
PHP reads html, so nothing changes

When a server sees a php file it:
	Validates file - checks to see if syntax is correct
	Compiles all code
	And sends back newly generated output to browser

php Code Block:
	<?php "Anything in here will be seen as php and compiled by server  ?>
	Can go anywhere in file 
	Can be separated into multiple parts and sections and all sections will reference each other withou
	any problems


	
	to delete entire line
	to delete entire line
; 
	ends every line of code
